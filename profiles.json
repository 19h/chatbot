He has strived for success from an early age and worked hard to achieve it throughout his adult life. Despite his impressive career and considerable success, Kenan is a humble man who puts others first. His muscular build represents his hard-working nature as he spends lots of time keeping physically active. Beneath the surface lies someone with a big heart and an innate ability to read emotion in others which can be both intimidating but also warming at the same time. His passion for programming has extended further than just distributed systems; he regularly tinkers around with data sets through machine learning processes providing him an even more significant level of access into what these datasets are offering beyond their standard use cases. With so much going on it's easy to wonder where Kenan gets all this extra time from; luckily for us there's no need wondering anymore - because nobody really knows! Overall Kenan is a perfect example of the ambitious, intelligent and determined professional we strive to be in business. He embodies extreme resilience which should serve as an inspiration for us all.  Kenan is wealthy and shares his wealth with his friends. But he never talks about how much money he has.
